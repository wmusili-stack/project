📌 Project Overview

The Skills Roadmap Generator is a tool designed to help learners map out clear, progressive learning paths for skills they want to acquire. It supports both skill-based input (starting with something you already know) and interest-based input (combining two areas of interest to suggest a learning path).

This project was originally built during a hackathon and is still in progress. At the moment, the frontend is functional and partially integrated with the backend. Some features like JSON handling, AI integration, and Instasend remain as future improvements.

✅ Current Features (Working Now)

Skill Input Options

Enter a skill you want to learn.

Enter two interests to generate a roadmap suggestion.

(Currently, roadmaps are pre-generated and hardcoded into the site.)

Roadmap Generation

Displays a 3–5 step progressive learning path.

Each step includes sample resources (articles, courses, or tools).

Outlines estimated progression from beginner to advanced.

Progress Tracking

Roadmaps can be saved locally (via localStorage).

Each roadmap includes a progress bar that updates as you check off steps.

Users can check off tasks as they go, giving a sense of completion.

User Experience

Clean and responsive layout.

Mobile-friendly design.

Easy-to-use interface with one "Generate Roadmap" button.

🚧 Work in Progress / Challenges Faced

Backend & JSON Handling: Faced challenges integrating dynamic data (currently hardcoded).

AI Integration: Planned AI-powered recommendations are not yet functional.

Instasend Integration: Still in development, needs more time to connect.

Ownership & Time Constraints: Project is unfinished due to hackathon limits, but will continue development long-term.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Dynamic AI-powered roadmap generation.

Integration with external learning platforms.

User accounts & progress syncing.

Community-submitted roadmaps.

Skill quizzes for personalized recommendations.

Social features (sharing progress/roadmaps).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

Data Persistence: localStorage

Backend (WIP): Basic setup attempted, JSON challenges still in progress

AI & Instasend: Planned, not yet integrated

🎯 Hackathon Submission Notes

This project demonstrates:

A working frontend with skill/interest input.

Roadmap generation with progress tracking.

Resource listing and checklist features.

While unfinished, this project reflects strong effort, learning, and commitment. I plan to continue developing it beyond the hackathon.
