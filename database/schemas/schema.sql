-- ==================== RELATIONSHIPS OVERVIEW ====================

/*
Database Relationships:

1. Users (1) â†’ Roadmaps (Many)
   - One user can create multiple roadmaps
   - Each roadmap belongs to one user

2. Users (1) â†’ Progress (Many) 
   - One user can have progress on multiple roadmaps
   - Each progress record belongs to one user

3. Roadmaps (1) â†’ Progress (Many)
   - One roadmap can be tracked by multiple users
   - Each progress record tracks one roadmap

4. Future relationships (for later features):
   - Users â†’ Followers (Many-to-Many)
   - Roadmaps â†’ Comments (One-to-Many)
   - Roadmaps â†’ Tags (Many-to-Many)
   - Users â†’ Achievements (One-to-Many)
*/

-- ==================== SAMPLE QUERIES ====================

/*
Common Queries This Schema Supports:

1. Get user's active roadmaps:
   SELECT r.* FROM roadmaps r 
   JOIN progress p ON r.id = p.roadmap_id 
   WHERE p.user_id = ? AND p.status IN ('not_started', 'in_progress');

2. Find popular public roadmaps:
   SELECT * FROM roadmaps 
   WHERE is_public = TRUE AND status = 'published'
   ORDER BY views DESC, likes DESC;

3. Search roadmaps by text:
   SELECT * FROM roadmaps 
   WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description || ' ' || skill_name) 
   @@ plainto_tsquery('english', ?);

4. Get user learning statistics:
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total_roadmaps,
     SUM(completed_steps) as total_completed_steps,
     AVG(completion_percentage) as avg_completion,
     SUM(time_spent) as total_time_spent,
     MAX(longest_streak) as best_streak
   FROM progress WHERE user_id = ?;

5. Find users with highest streaks:
   SELECT u.username, p.longest_streak 
   FROM users u JOIN progress p ON u.id = p.user_id
   ORDER BY p.longest_streak DESC;
